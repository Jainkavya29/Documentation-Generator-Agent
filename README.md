## 📂 Usage

Follow this workflow to process documents and generate professional documentation automatically.

### Step 1: Upload Document
Upload a document in **TXT**, **PDF**, or **DOCX** format to the environment.

### Step 2: Extract and Process Text
The agent automatically detects the file type and extracts text accordingly, ensuring consistent input for downstream AI models.

### Step 3: Generate Documentation
The system processes the extracted text through summarization, structure detection, simplification, and compression pipelines to generate structured documentation.

### Step 4: Export as PDF
The final output is exported as a **professionally formatted PDF** ready for sharing or submission.

## 🌐 ScaleDown API Integration

The **ScaleDown API** is the core engine that enables the agent to handle large documents and repositories that would normally exceed LLM token limits.

- **Intelligent Compression** – Achieves approximately **80% reduction** in document size  
- **Context Retention** – Maintains semantic continuity across **100+ pages or multiple files**  
- **Reliability** – Includes a safe fallback to the original text if compression quality is not optimal

## 📄 Output Components

For every processed document, the system generates a structured, multi-layered output:

- **Summary** – Condensed overview of the core content  
- **Structure** – Extracted hierarchy of headings and sections  
- **Easy Text** – Simplified, plain-language explanation for non-technical users  
- **PDF** – Fully formatted documentation ready for distribution

## 🧠 Conclusion

The **Documentation Generator Agent** demonstrates how AI can automate one of the most neglected yet critical tasks in software development — **documentation**.

It is fast, scalable, and designed for modern developer ecosystems, making it well-suited for hackathons, research demos, and real-world applications.
